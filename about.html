          Jerry Myers has been head over heals in love with his beautiful wife LaTonya Myers for over 30 years! Together they have been blessed with three amazing daughters and three wonderful grandchildren. Jerry started in the car business in early 2001 selling cars at a small but successful dealership in Neosho Mo. (Hartland Motors). Steve Hart the owner of the small dealership began training and pouring his long time proven success principles into Jerry grooming him to become the lot salesman and manager. Jerry went on from there a few years later to start working at “Roper GMC” in Joplin Mo. Roper was a larger more corporate dealership at this time and had multiple stores in town he could sell from.
            </p>
            <p class="generic-p">
              Jerry was privileged to meet and work alongside Shane Werberger on the same sales floor. Jerry gleaned even more successful knowledge and wisdom in the art of customer service and sales from Shane who at that time was their top producer! Jerry left Roper in 2003 to join the “Fletcher Auto Group” in Joplin Mo. at Nissan working with some of the smartest and brightest managers in the business at that time. Jerry became a top producer at Fletcher and was honored numerous times for his performance as a sales professional. Frank Fletcher and his incredible work ethic and customer service approach has always been a huge inspiration for Jerry. Franks way of doing business taught Jerry even more about being a servant to his customers, as well as, helping him to understand how to overcome the many hurdles customers need you to overcome in order to help them achieve their vehicle goals.             </p>
            <p class="generic-p">
            During his time at Nissan Jerry began following great leader trainers in the industry of sales and marketing. Jerry attended many sales and personal development style breakthrough events nationwide. Through these training experiences Jerry was able to release many of his false beliefs and issues that were weighing him down. After these events and continued reading and study Jerry went on to work in the Network Marketing field for many years while still selling cars. Jerry quickly became successful in his side MLM business and eventually began working as a trainer consultant for his Network Marketing Team and business. Jerry left the MLM field to begin his own Personal Development company “Freedom Now” helping entrepreneurs, business owners, and sales professionals break through their own issues and create success in their business and life! Jerry has always been a leader and top producer in the car business. You need look no further to find someone trustworthy and honest that truly cares about you and your needs as a customer. For Jerry customer service has been the KEY ingredient to his successful and long term relationships with his huge customer base. You deserve to work with someone like Jerry who has your best interest in mind all the time without fail.
